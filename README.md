# pmemkv-java

Java bindings for pmemkv, using Java Native Interface. Currently functionally equal to pmemkv in version 1.0.
Some of the new functionalities (from pmemkv 1.1+) are not available yet.

All known issues and limitations are logged as GitHub issues or are described
in pmemkv's man pages.

Java API is documented with javadocs and can be found as html here:

- [master](https://pmem.io/pmemkv-java/master/html/index.html)
- [v1.0](https://pmem.io/pmemkv-java/v1.0/html/index.html)

## Dependencies

* [pmemkv](https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv) - Key-Value Datastore for Persistent Memory
  * pmemkv source package (pmemkv-devel or libpmemkv-dev)
* Java Development Kit 8
* gcc-c++ compiler
* [Apache Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org) - build system

## Usage

### Maven repository

This pmemkv binding is accesible from maven repository:

[io.pmem namespace @ maven.org](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/pmem/pmemkv-root)

You can add our project as a dependency and use it freely. Make sure to use it e.g. like this:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pmem</groupId>
  <artifactId>pmemkv-root</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Installation

Start by installing [pmemkv](https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv/blob/master/INSTALLING.md)
(currently at least in version **1.0.2**) in your system.

It may be necessary to [configure a proxy](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html)
and set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. Set `JAVA_HOME` variable with directory containing
JDK 8 installed typically in `/usr/lib/jvm/`, command below will set first directory matching to
1.8.0, but path can differ in some exotic distros:

```sh
export JAVA_HOME=`ls -d1 /usr/lib/jvm/* | grep "1.8.0" | head -n 1`
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

Clone the pmemkv-java tree:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv-java.git
cd pmemkv-java
```

Build and install Java Native Interface (JNI) and java bindings:

```sh
mvn install
```

If dependencies (pmemkv, libpmemobj-cpp, pmdk, etc.) are installed in non-standard
location(s) it may be also necessary to set up:
**CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH** and **LIBRARY_PATH** for compiling and linking JNI code (gcc env. variables),
**LD_LIBRARY_PATH** for examples and tests build/execution.

```sh
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=<path_to_includes> \
LIBRARY_PATH=<path_to_libs> \
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path_to_libs> mvn install
```

## Testing

This library includes a set of automated tests that exercise all functionality.

```sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path_to_libs> mvn test
```

to execute tests on non-default path (`/dev/shm`), setup desired directory, e.g.:

```sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path_to_libs> mvn test -Dtest.db.dir=/my/test/dir
```

## Examples

We use `/dev/shm` with [emulated persistent memory](https://pmem.io/2016/02/22/pm-emulation.html)
in examples.

Examples can be found within this repository in [examples directory](https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv-java/tree/master/examples).
To execute them, run e.g.:

```sh
cd examples
mvn package
PMEM_IS_PMEM_FORCE=1 java -ea -Xms1G -jar StringExample/target/StringExample-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

If you want to use our examples with pmemkv from maven repository, you can take a look at our
[testing script](./utils/docker/run-maven-example.sh) executed in our [dedicated CI workflow](./.github/workflows/maven.yml).
